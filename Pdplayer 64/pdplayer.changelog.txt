1.0.1.29:

  Pdplayer can now use 3D lookup tables. The supported formats are Autodesk .3dl,
  Nucoda .cms and Iridas .cube. .3dl tables are assumed to have 12 bits of output
  (range 0..4095). .3dl and .cube are assumed to contain sRGB values by default,
  whereas .cms is assumed to be linear.

  As a result of the changes, the option "Linear Cineon" has been removed. The
  same effect may be achieved by using the supplied "identity.lut" 1D table, found
  in the LUTs subfolder of the installation directory. In the same place one can
  find a 1D lookup table for viewing Panalog DPX files, named "panalog.cms".
